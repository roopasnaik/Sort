The provided program creates a GUI for sorting algorithm visualization using Tkinter. Here's what you can expect when you run the program:

1. A window titled "Sorting Algorithm Visualizer" will appear.
2. You'll see a label prompting you to enter numbers separated by space.
3. Enter a list of numbers into the entry field.
4. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
5. The program will display a canvas where the sorting process will be visualized.
6. As the sorting algorithm progresses, you'll see rectangles representing the numbers being rearranged on the canvas.
7. The visualization will continue until the sorting process is complete.
8. You can adjust the speed of the animation by changing the value of `time.sleep()` in the code.

This program provides a visual representation of the sorting algorithm in action, allowing you to observe how different sorting techniques rearrange elements to sort the list.
